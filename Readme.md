# Znoop

This will be a data dump tool (like oc -c or hexdump -c) for Z-Machine binary story files (prompted by fun with Ryan Gordon's recent [MojoZork](https://github.com/icculus/mojozork)).

To start, I'm replicating the output of Inform's [ZTools](https://www.inform-fiction.org/zmachine/ztools.html) Infodump.

## Install and run

Clone the repo or download the zip and expand it. Run with MRI Ruby: `ruby znoop.rb`.

## Misc project notes

Hmm.
